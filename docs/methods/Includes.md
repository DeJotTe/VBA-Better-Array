### Description
The `Includes()` method determines whether the array includes a certain value among its entries, returning `True` or `False` as appropriate.

### Arguments
#### `SearchElement` (Variant)
The value to search for.
#### *Optional* `FromIndex` (Long)
The position in this array at which to begin searching for `searchElement`; the first character to be searched is found at `fromIndex` for positive values of `fromIndex`, or at the array's `Length` property + `fromIndex` for negative values of `fromIndex` (using the absolute value of `fromIndex` as the number of characters from the end of the array at which to start the search). Defaults to the array's `Base` property.
### Returns
### (Boolean)
`True` if the array includes valueToFind, `False` if not.
