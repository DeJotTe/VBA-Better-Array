Arrays with more than two dimensions are unsupported and will be returned unchanged. Uses an implementation of the [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm

### Arguments
#### *Optional* `SortColumn` (Long)
The column in a two dimensional array to be used in the comparison.

### Returns
#### (Variant)
