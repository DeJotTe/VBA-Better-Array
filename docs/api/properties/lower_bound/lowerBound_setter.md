# LowerBound Let Accessor

## Description
Sets the lower bound (starting index) of the array. If the new lower bound differs from the lower bound of the existing array the array will be re-based to start at the new lower bound value - this will change the `UpperBound` property but leave the `Length` property unchanged.

## Parameters
### `Value` (Long)
The new LowerBound (base index) of the array.

## Returns
**None**
