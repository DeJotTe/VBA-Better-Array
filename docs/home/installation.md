# Installation

Each release has two separate `.zip` archives:

[Standalone](https://github.com/Senipah/VBA-Better-Array/raw/master/releases/latest/Standalone.Zip)
: This just contains the latest stable BetterArray.cls file and is all you need to start using this library.

[With Unit Tests](https://github.com/Senipah/VBA-Better-Array/raw/master/releases/latest/WithTests.Zip)
: For more the more advanced/ inquisitive user, this archive also contains all of the unit tests and their dependencies. If you want to run the unit tests yourself or add, change or modify the `BetterArray.cls` in any way then download this one. **Note:** Unit Tests depend on [Rubberduck VBA](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck) as the test runner.

Once you have chosen and downloaded the best archive for your purposes, simply extract the files and import them into a new or existing VBA project. To import, either drag and drop the `.bas` and `.cls` files into the "VBE Project Explorer" pane, or from the VBE choose Insert > File.

If you are looking for a specific version see the [Releases](https://github.com/Senipah/VBA-Better-Array/releases/) page.
