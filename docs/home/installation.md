# Installation

*Note* - This library is unfinished and is in a pre-release state.

Head on over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Senipah/VBA-Better-Array/releases/) page to find the latest release. 

Each release has two separate `.zip` archives:

Standalone
: This just contains the latest stable BetterArray.cls file and is all you need to start using this library.

With Unit Tests
: For more the more advanced/ inquisitive user, this archive also contains all of the unit tests and their dependencies. If you want to run the unit tests yourself or add, change or modify the `BetterArray.cls` in any way then download this one.

Once you have chosen and downloaded the best archive for your purposes, simply extract the files and import them into a new or existing VBA project. To import, either drag and drop the `.bas` and `.cls` files into the "VBE Project Explorer" pane, or from the VBE choose Insert > File.

That's it! Check out the Getting Started page to learn how to create you first BetterArray or jump straight into the API Docs to check out the available Properties/Methods.
